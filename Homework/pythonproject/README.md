Python Project Description
import math and tkinter imports the math and interface module
Tk() brings the GUI package
.Canvas creates the plane that will graph the functions
c.pack() packs widgets in rows and columns
c.createline creates the y and x axis
def defines the function 
return creates the equation 
for x in range sets the range for x in the function 
c.create_rectangle creates a rectangle for each y coordinate to draw the graph
print (defined function) outputs the equation 
same thing with def v(x) a(x) j(x)
tk.mainloop() is used when the application is ready to run
