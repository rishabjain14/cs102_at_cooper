## Python Project Description.

```
import math and tkinter imports the math and interface module.
Tk() brings the GUI package.
.Canvas creates the plane that will graph the functions.
c.pack() packs widgets in rows and columns.
c.createline creates the y and x axis.
def defines the function.
return creates the equation.
for x in range sets the range for x in the function. 
c.create_rectangle creates a rectangle for each y coordinate to draw the graph.
print (defined function) outputs the equation. 
same thing with def v(x) a(x) j(x).
tk.mainloop() is used when the application is ready to run.
```
