## Simon Says Description

```
The Team: Rishab Jain and Sid Pinto

Project Description: This is a simple text game in the terminal. 
The rules are just like the classic game of Simon says; if Simon says to do it, do it.
The game becomes more are more difficult as it progresses, opening with the simplest questions and ending with the most difficult.

Project Process: We aimed to create a game that took the classic concept of Simon Says and make it more difficult. 
We wanted the game to start over once the player lost but the mechanism for doing so was far more difficult than we expected. 
Because we ran into so many errors with starting over the game, we decided to let the user run the game again if they wanted to start over. 
Additionally, we ran into issues with scanning character string imputs with spaces.
For this reaon we had to search for help online to let our code read sentences entered by the user.
